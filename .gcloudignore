# This file specifies files that are *not* uploaded to Google Cloud Platform
# using gcloud. It follows the same syntax as .gitignore, with the addition of
# "#!include" directives (which insert the entries of the given .gitignore-style
# file at that point).
#
# For more information, run:
#   $ gcloud topic gcloudignore
#
.gcloudignore
# If you would like to upload your .git directory, .gitignore file or files
# from your .gitignore file, remove the corresponding line
# below:

.git
.gitignore
Pipfile
Pipfile.lock

# Apply all .gitignore contents to .gcloudignore
#!include:.gitignore

# Include otherwise excluded files or directories by starting with an exclamation point
!app.yaml
!env/

# Python pycache:
__pycache__/
# Ignored by the build system
